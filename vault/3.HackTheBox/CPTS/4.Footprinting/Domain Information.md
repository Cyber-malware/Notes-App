we identify the hosts directly accessible from the Internet and not hosted by third-party providers. This is because we are not allowed to test the hosts without the permission of third-party providers.

```bash
for i in $(cat subdomainlist);do host $i | grep "has address" | grep inlanefreight.com | cut -d" " -f1,4;done

blog.inlanefreight.com 10.129.24.93

**DNS records:**

To find DNS record of systrem

```bash
dig any inlanefreight.com
```

- `A` records: We recognize the IP addresses that point to a specific (sub)domain through the A record.
- `MX` records: The mail server records show us which mail server is responsible for managing the emails for the company. 
- `NS` records: These kinds of records show which name servers are used to resolve the FQDN to IP addresses. 
- `TXT` records: this type of record often contains verification keys for different third-party providers and other security aspects of DNS, such as [SPF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7208), [DMARC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7489), and [DKIM](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6376).
